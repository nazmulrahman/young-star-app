üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to get a local copy of Young-Star up and running on your machine.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js: Download & Install Node.js (which includes npm).

npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn.

Firebase CLI:

npm install -g firebase-tools

1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/young-star.git
cd young-star

(Replace your-username with your actual GitHub username or the repository URL)

2. Install Dependencies
npm install
# OR
yarn install

3. Firebase Project Setup
Young-Star relies on Firebase for its backend. You'll need to set up your own Firebase project:

Create a Firebase Project:

Go to the Firebase Console.

Click "Add project" and follow the steps to create a new project.

Enable Firebase Services:

In your Firebase project, enable Firestore Database and Authentication.

For Authentication, enable Email/Password and Google sign-in providers.

Get Firebase Configuration:

In your Firebase project settings (Project overview -> Project settings -> General), find the "Your apps" section.

If you don't have a web app, click the </> icon to add a new web app.

Copy the firebaseConfig object.

Update src/App.js:

Open src/App.js in your cloned project.

Locate the firebaseConfig object near the top of the file.

Replace the placeholder apiKey, authDomain, projectId, storageBucket, messagingSenderId, and appId values with your actual Firebase project's configuration.

Set up Firestore Security Rules:

In the Firebase Console, navigate to "Firestore Database" -> "Rules" tab.

Replace the default rules with the following to ensure proper access control for your application:

rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {

    // Users Collection:
    // Allows any authenticated user to read all user profiles.
    // Allows users to create their own profile on signup (if it doesn't exist).
    // Allows an authenticated user to update their own profile.
    // IMPORTANT: Allows instructors to update *any* user's role (specifically for approving instructor applications).
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow create: if request.auth != null; // For new user registration
      allow update: if request.auth != null && (request.auth.uid == userId || get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'instructor');
      allow delete: if false; // Deletion should be handled by backend/admin only
    }

    // Tasks Collection:
    // Allows all authenticated users to read tasks.
    // Only instructors can create, update, or delete tasks.
    match /tasks/{taskId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow create, update, delete: if request.auth != null && get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'instructor';
    }

    // Submissions Collection:
    // Allows all authenticated users to read submissions (students can read their own, instructors can read all).
    // Students can create and update their own submissions.
    // Instructors can update submissions (for grading).
    match /submissions/{submissionId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow create: if request.auth != null && request.resource.data.studentId == request.auth.uid; // Student can create their own submission
      allow update: if request.auth != null && (request.resource.data.studentId == request.auth.uid || get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'instructor');
      allow delete: if false; // Deletion should be handled by backend/admin only
    }

    // Meetings Collection:
    // Allows all authenticated users to read meetings.
    // Only instructors can create, update, or delete meetings.
    match /meetings/{meetingId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow create, update, delete: if request.auth != null && get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'instructor';
    }

    // Announcements Collection:
    // Allows all authenticated users to read announcements.
    // Only instructors can create, update, or delete announcements.
    match /announcements/{announcementId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow create, update, delete: if request.auth != null && get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'instructor';
    }

    // Messages Collection:
    // Allows authenticated users to read messages where they are either the sender or receiver.
    // Allows authenticated users to create messages.
    match /messages/{messageId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null && (resource.data.senderId == request.auth.uid || resource.data.receiverId == request.auth.uid);
      allow create: if request.auth != null && request.resource.data.senderId == request.auth.uid;
      allow update, delete: if false; // Messages are generally immutable or deleted by backend
    }

    // Notes Collection:
    // Allows students to read, create, update, and delete their own notes.
    match /notes/{noteId} {
      allow read, create, update, delete: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.studentId;
    }

    // Instructor Applications Collection:
    // Allows any authenticated user to create an application (role 'pending').
    // Only instructors can read and update/delete these applications (to approve/reject).
    match /instructorApplications/{applicationId} {
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      allow read, update, delete: if request.auth != null && get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'instructor';
    }
  }
}

Click "Publish" to apply the rules.
